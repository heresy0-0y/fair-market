## Schemas:
 
const Post = new Schema(
 {
   subject: { type: String, required: true },
   content: { type: String, required: true },
 },
 { timestamps: true }
)
 
const User = new Schema(
 {
   name: { type: String, required: true },
   imgURL: { type: String, required: true }
 },
 { timestamps: true }
)

## Overview:
Our Fair Market app will offer a platform for shoppers to navigate through and review community-based shops. Upon sign-in, users can review these shops and make posts on the different StoreFront socials. Users can click on these posts to be directed toward a social post detail page. We hope that Fair Market will serve as a platform to empower often-overlooked under under-resourced communities of shops.
